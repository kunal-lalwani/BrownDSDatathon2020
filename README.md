Predicting Stability after COVID-19

How long will it take for the number of travelers from China to the USA to rebound back to pre-outbreak baseline travelers during the COVID-19 outbreak based on SARS outbreak analysis?


The Problem 

The threat of a megavirus has been an impending source of fear for the global society. From the Bubonic Plague of the 1350s to diseases like SARS, the idea of mass sickness and death has loomed. Although our medical technology has come along way and is rapidly increasing, epidemics cause global anxiety, which is only exacerbated by the media.

As we find ourselves in the midst of COVID-19, the coronavirus, we believe it is integral to contain fear with the inference of past results through science. By carefully studying a previous epidemic stemming from China, we have produced predictions to aid in comforting people during this time. Large scale fear also has economic implications. Many people hold onto their money instead of spending it when there is uncertainty about the future, which can lead to recessions in the economy. From the perspective of investors, it may keep a lot of business to be able to give clients an estimation of when the market will reach its original levels before the outbreak.
